> There're just too many things that I haven't review systematically. 

I took NLP fall 2019 but I wasn't paying much attention that time due to the early start of my photography interests. This is another series of debt to be paid. 

The other day I came across Kevin Gimpel NLP when browsing Instagram. (Yeah Instagram sometimes is useful....) I was instantly amazed by how clearly the topic was discussed and how well the videos were made. Such a boss!
