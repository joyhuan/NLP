# NLP

> There're just too many things that I haven't review systematically. 

I took NLP in Fall 2019 but I wasn't paying much attention because I just started doing photography that time. This is another series of debt to be paid. 

The other day I came across Kevin Gimpel NLP when browsing Instagram. (Yeah Instagram sometimes is useful....) I was instantly amazed by how clearly the topic was discussed and how well the videos were made. Such a boss! 

## Update 11/16/20 on Why review is helpful
When I first took ML or NLP my focus was on the algorithms, but not much on its contexts. I'm pushed to learn algos one by one and implement part of them. I "drifted" with constant deadlines and had no time to think about the "flow". Now when I revisit it I feel like it's more about matching problem of what you have and what you want. Similar to how we would choose data structure, we choose algos based on the special requirments/conditios of the problem and its limitations. Everything has their position in this whole frame. I was just too busy to "learn" the course to "learn" the materials.
